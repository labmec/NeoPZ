   In this documentation the most relevant methods and classes are presented and discussed. Users are encouraged to use Doxygen to generate a complete documentation.

About
-----

The NeoPZ environment is a object oriented environment for the development
finite element simulations.
 
The NeoPZ environment (in the future quoted as simply NeoPZ) incorporates
several advanced finite element technologies in a single coherent structure,
allowing its user to develop sophisticated simulations in a short period of
time.


Motivation: Why develop a finite element library?
-------------------------------------------------

During my PhD work (late 1980's) I developed hp-adaptive finite element 
algorithms applied to the simulation of compressible fluid flow. The first 
version of the adaptive mesh datastructure dates back to 1984.

I soon noticed that adaptivity is a universal concept which can be applied to
virtually any finite element simulation. During the time I studied in Texas,
adaptivity was applied to the Stokes equations,to plasticity, to thermal
problems, convection problems etc.

On the other hand, It was obvious that writing an hp-adaptive code requires a
major investment. It takes at least two years to write and validate a three
dimensional adaptive finite element code.

At that time I imagined it would be possible to write a finite element
framework that would be allow its user to apply hp-adaptive strategies to
different systems of differential equations in a single framework.

More recently, the concept of generality has been extended in that the NeoPZ
library allows its user to choose the approximation space as well. One can
approximate a differential equation with continuous or discontinuous
approximation spaces. Denise Siqueira implemented two dimensional HDiv spaces
in the library.
 
Objectives
----------

The objective of the NeoPZ environment is to provide its user access to
advanced finite element technologies within a coherent framework. Wherever
possible those technologies should be able to interact with each other.

.. What is meant by "advanced technologies" is documented in the section ADD_SEC
